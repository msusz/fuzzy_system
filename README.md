# fuzzy_system
Implementation of a fuzzy system in Python using Simpful library. 
Problem description (from "Artificial intelligence - a guide to intelligent systems" by Michael Negnevitsky):
A service centre keeps spare parts and repairs failed ones. A customer brings a failed item and recieves a spare of the same type. Failed parts are repered, placed on the shelf, and thus become spares. If the requiredspare is available on the shelf, the costumer has to wait until the needed item becomes available. The objective here is to advise a manager of the service centre on certain decision policies to keep the customers satisfied.
